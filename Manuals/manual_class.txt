This manual helps for testing the proposed HiDe-MK for a classification example (dichotomous trait)

Steps:
1. Create a folder somewhere to keep the installed libraries.
Let us call this folder: 
C:/users/hide_mk/

Download Hide_MK from Github and put its content into this folder. 

2. Install Tensorflow version 2.6
pip3 install --user tensorflow==2.6

If with pip3 give error, please try with pip. . 

3. Change the value for the variable 'outputDir' in the file 'HiDe_Class_GIO.py' which should be in the path 'C:/users/hide_mk/Python' to:

outputDir = 'C:/users/hide_mk/Simulation data/ class/'

This helps to read the datasets from the folder 'class' in in the file 'HiDe_Class_GIO.py'.


4. Run the example python script 'HiDe_Class_GIO.py' which loads the following libraries:
tensorflow/2.6
keras/2.6
numpy
pandas
SKlearn

5- The output of this file is a csv file with name "FI_Class1.csv" which includes the feature importance scores (FIs). 

You are done with learning from data and extracting FIs. This approaximately takes half an hour. 

-> How to get FDR and Power through the R scrip: 

6- First, install the following packages throgu the R: 

install.packages("glmnet")
install.packages("knockoff")
install.packages("data.table")

7- Then, open the file "FDR_Pow_MK" throug the folder 'R' of the downloaded package. 

8- Again, change the line 'path_data' in this file to read the data and stored FIs which was learned by the neuo-net. 

9- Run this R script and you get FDR and Power for different target FDR levels from 0.01 to 0.20 by step size 0.01. 

10- A csv file "Stat_knockoff.csv" in the folder "Simulation data" is generated which includes a row with 40 values. The first 20 values are observed FDRs and the second 20 values are emprical power for the corresponding FDRs. 

11- Done!
