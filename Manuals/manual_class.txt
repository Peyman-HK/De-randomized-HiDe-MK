This manual helps for testing the proposed HiDe-MK for a classification example (dichotomous trait)

Steps:
1. Create a folder somewhere to keep the installed libraries.
Let us call this folder: 
C:/users/De-randomized-HiDe-MK/

Download  De-randomized-HiDe-MK from Github and put its content into this folder. 

2. Install Tensorflow version 2.6
pip3 install --user tensorflow==2.6

If pip3 gives error, please try with pip or conda.  

3. Change the value for the variable 'outputDir' in line 72 of file 'HiDe_Class_GIO.py' in the path 'C:/users/hide_mk/Python' to:

outputDir = 'C:/users/De-randomized-HiDe-MK/Simulation data/class/'

This fix the address of data files.


4. Run the example python script 'HiDe_Class_GIO.py' which loads the following libraries:
tensorflow/2.6
keras/2.6
numpy
pandas
SKlearn

5- The output of this file is a csv file with name "FI_Class_1.csv" which is the vector of the feature importance scores (FIs). 

You are done with learning from data and extracting FIs. This approaximately takes an hour to two hours. 


---> How to get FDR and Power through the R scrip:  <---

6- First, install the following packages throgu the R: 

install.packages(c('glmnet', 'data.matrix', 'knockoff'))

7- Then, open the file "FDR_Pow_MK.R" throug the folder 'R' of the downloaded package. 

8- Again, change the line 'path_data' (line 22) in this file to read the FIs (which was learned by the neuo-net), Beta, and Y. 

9- Update or change the path for source('/home/users/peymanhk/PROJECT_2/Simulated/GOI/KnockoffScreen_updated.R') to where KnockoffScreen_updated.R is located in your PC of folder "De-randomized-HiDe-MK"

10- Run this R script and you get FDR and Power for different target FDR levels from 0.01 to 0.20 by step size 0.01. 

11- A csv file "Stat_stabilize_HiDe_MK_Class.csv" in the folder "Simulation data" is generated which includes a row with 40 values. 
The first 20 values are observed/empricial FDRs and the second 20 values are the emprical power for the corresponding FDRs. 

12- Done!
